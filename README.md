# sqlalchemy-challenge

Hi,

this is my approch to the sql alchemy challenge.

In the repository you will find a folder SurfsUp, with following items:
1. Subfolder Recources with provided csv viles and sqlite db
2. jupyter notebook "climate" with the sulution to the first part of the challenge.
3. flask app: app.py


note: I tried using OrderedDict to have a print out for the last route organized the way I wanted, but it didnt't work out.
I haven't found the solution yet. RegardlessI left that part of the code.

Thanks,

Katharina
